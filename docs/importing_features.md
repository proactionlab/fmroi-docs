Importing new features
======================

The implementation of fMROI was thoughtfully designed to prioritize user-friendliness and facilitate the integration of new features. This was accomplished through a clear separation between the main GUI implementation and its modules, including ROI creation algorithms, Image templates, and extra tools. By adopting this modular architecture, collaborators can effortlessly contribute new features by embedding them within the fMROI GUI, without requiring a deep understanding of other parts of the fMROI code.
